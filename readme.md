**Express App Interview Assignment**

**Objective:**  
Develop a RESTful API using Express.js framework backed by SQLite and Sequelize ORM. The API will serve as the backend for a platform where users can create chatbots. These chatbots will have conversations with end users.

**Entities:**  
1. User
2. Chatbot
3. Conversation
4. EndUser (The individual interacting with the chatbot)

**Entity Relationships:**  
1. A User can have multiple Chatbots.
2. A Chatbot belongs to a User and can have multiple Conversations.
3. A Conversation belongs to a Chatbot and involves an EndUser.
4. An EndUser is identified by a name and an email.

**Technical Requirements:**  
1. Use Express.js as the framework for building the API.
2. Use SQLite as the database.
3. Use Sequelize as the ORM.

**Endpoints:**  

1. **Users**  
    - `POST /users` - Create a new user  
    - `GET /users` - List all users  
    - `GET /users/:id` - Retrieve a single user  
    - `PUT /users/:id` - Update a user  
    - `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete a user  

2. **Chatbots**  
    - `POST /users/:userId/chatbots` - Create a new chatbot for a user  
    - `GET /users/:userId/chatbots` - List all chatbots for a user  
    - `GET /chatbots/:chatbotId` - Retrieve a single chatbot  
    - `PUT /chatbots/:chatbotId` - Update a chatbot  
    - `DELETE /chatbots/:chatbotId` - Delete a chatbot  

3. **Conversations**  
    - `POST /chatbots/:chatbotId/conversations` - Start a new conversation for a chatbot  
    - `GET /chatbots/:chatbotId/conversations` - List all conversations for a chatbot  
    - `GET /conversations/:conversationId` - Retrieve a single conversation  
    - `PUT /conversations/:conversationId` - Update a conversation (for instance, to mark it as completed)  
    - `DELETE /conversations/:conversationId` - End/delete a conversation  

4. **EndUsers**  
    - `POST /endusers` - Register a new end user  
    - `GET /endusers` - List all end users  
    - `GET /endusers/:endUserId` - Retrieve details of a single end user  
    - `PUT /endusers/:endUserId` - Update end user details  
    - `DELETE /endusers/:endUserId` - Delete an end user  

**Bonus:**  
- Implement authentication for the user. Consider using libraries like `passport.js`.
- Implement a search feature for chatbots or end users.
- Implement pagination on endpoints that return lists of entities.

**Submission:**  
Provide the source code for your application, a README with setup instructions, and a Postman collection (or similar) for testing the API endpoints.
